Dev log for week of November 21st

Accomplished:
-Finished the DB interface, finally!!! Hopefully.
-Decided that the way I was storing questions and answers in the DB was stupid and changed the
whole thing to be more concise and save on storage
-Finally implemented match caching in the DB interface, whether we use it or not
-Realized I needed to add password storage and retrieval to the database, so I did that

Comments:
-It's nice that the project is finally nearing completion, it just doesn't feel like it is
anywhere near done yet though...

Goals for next week:
-Wrap up the database stuff in time for the final demo
