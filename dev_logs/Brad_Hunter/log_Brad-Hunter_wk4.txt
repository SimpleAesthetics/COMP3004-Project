Dev log for week of October 10th

Accomplished:
-Modifications to the DB schema to fit the group's idea of the app
-Thought about how to store environments, questionnaires and groups in the DB

Comments:
-My idea of the database and the rest of the groups' ideas clash
--I'd much prefer to do stuff using numeric IDs that can be guaranteed to be unique
-Installing Spring Tooling seems to have broken Eclipse...

Goals for next week:
-Get DB interface mostly finished in time for the project demo
