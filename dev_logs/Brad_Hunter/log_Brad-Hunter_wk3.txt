Dev log for week of October 3rd

Accomplished:
-Chose to go with the SQLite database technology (minimal overhead, full SQL semantics)
-Database interface framework created

Comments:
-The interface is going to be large...lots of function calls
-Database design not necesarily the best, but it makes sense from an internet application standpoint

Goals for next week:
-Finalize DB schema
-Download and test the REST server Jon created (and install the related frameworks)
