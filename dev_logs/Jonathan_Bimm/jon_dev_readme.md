# This folder contains the dev logs for Jonathan Bimm. #

## General Dev Logs Description: ##

The dev logs are based on our weekly cycle of work, which starts on a Wednesday, and continues until the following Wednesday. At the start of each cycle, we have a team meeting, where we discuss how things are going in the development process, and what work should be expected the following week.

  The dev logs prescribe to the following format:
  - Dev log title for the development week ending on a certain date
  - Detailed description of what was expected for the week
  - Items that were completed for that particular week, and whether the week was considered successful
  - Comments on what was completed (if any), which include
      - Unexpected incidents
      - Setbacks
  - Small and basic list of goals for the following week
